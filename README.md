# Fun Miscellaneous Projects

Realized it would probably be better to organize all my small projects into one
location. Won't get updated super often probably but we'll see.

Projects:

- [Writing to nRF52840 flash memory](https://github.com/anivelle/misc-projects/tree/main/write-flash) - Just a test on writing data to the flash memory 
  on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, which I am using for my [drone project](https://github.com/anivelle/drone-controller). Might use it to write configuration
  values to avoid performing calibration every single time I turn the drone on.
